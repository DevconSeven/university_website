This is my biggest and most ambitious project so far. I started building a website with a MySQL database running in the background and gradually expanded it, learning an incredible amount along the way! I learned how to work with HTML, how to use CSS for styling, and how frontend and backend interact through JavaScript and PHP. I also discovered how to read and manipulate data from an SQL database. Although I used AI assistance to build the project, I gained a deep understanding of web development. The login area was especially fascinating, as it introduced session handling and many core principles of web architecture. Itâ€™s not perfect, but my learning curve was steep and incredibly rewarding!
I used XAMPP for the database. It's an easy-to-install Apache distribution that includes MySQL, PHP, and more. You can download it here:
