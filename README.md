A personal web project built with MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I learned how to connect frontend and backend, handle sessions, and manage SQL data. Created with AI assistance, but the real value was the steep learning curve and hands-on experience in web development. Not perfect, but a big step forward!
